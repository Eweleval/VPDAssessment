 Problem Statement:
Create a simple iOS app that fetches data from an API and displays it in a
table view. The app should have the following functionality:
1. Fetch a list of items from the following API
endpoint:Â https://api.github.com/repositories
2. Parse the JSON response and display the item names in a table view.
3. When a user taps on an item, navigate to a detail view controller that
displays more information about the selected item.
4. Please create a design that best fits the solution.
Requirements:
1. Use Swift programming language and the latest version of Xcode.
2. Implement the networking code using URLSession.
3. Use Codable to parse the JSON response and model the data.
4. Display user in form of a list.
5. Implement proper error handling and provide appropriate UI feedback if
the API request fails.
6. Provide a clean and user-friendly UI design.
7. Provide a link that demos the result of the assessment.
Bonus Points (Optional):
1. Implement pull-to-refresh functionality to refresh the list of items.
2. Implement pagination to load more items as the user scrolls to the
bottom of the table view.
3. Implement caching to store the fetched data locally and provide offline
support.
